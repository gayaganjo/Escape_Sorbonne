Hello everyone and welcome to our project :

The Escape Sorbonne project is made by our team composed by Anis, Gaya and Lucile, three students at the University of Paris 8. We decide to work around the mythical building of the Sorbonne as part of our final project in the Mobile web design license program. 
Based on the property assets of the Sorbonne institution, the aim of this project is to create a mobile application and a website to highlight the history of the Sorbonne. To make it more attractive to students, the target is to enhance the heritage through digital
technology, notably through the design of historical content in our application.
Escape Sorbonne application is part of the main building of the Sorbonne in historic Paris district. This place has 800 years of history, from the Middle Ages up to the present day and it was built in 1253 by Robert de Sorbon or the name of Sorbonne, Melody Laurent, the project manager at SIRIS, the Inter-Service of The
Sorbonne University Computer Network, proposed to work around
the Sorbonne in order to enhance its historical and cultural heritage thanks
to an application that traces its history from its construction to today
through a game that contains multiple riddles.
Our project consists in creating a smartphone game containing riddles to
allow students to learn the history of the Sorbonne in a fun and entertaining
way. The game has two modes: a walk mode and a timed mode. In timed
mode, the user has a limited time to solve riddles. There is also a ranking
with the players who have answered the riddles the fastest in order to bring
some dynamics to the game and to create a spirit of competition.
Our application is intended for students who can access the main building
of the Sorbonne. Also, it is especially conceived to be used during heritage days as an attractive medium to learn more about the history of this emblematic place.
